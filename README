NAME
    Pod::Licensizer - Keep your project's AUTHOR and LICENSE sections in
    sync

SYNOPSIS
        # Command line:
        $ licensizer

        # API:
        use Pod::Licensizer;

        my $licensizer = Pod::Licensizer->new();
        $licensizer->load_file( "MyModule.pm" );

        $licensizer->author_patch( 'Bodo Bravo <bodo@bravo.com>' );
        $licensizer->license_patch( 'Copyright 2011 blah blah blah' );

        $licensizer->write_file();

DESCRIPTION
    Pod::Licensizer helps keeping AUTHOR and LICENSE sections in sync across
    many source files in a project.

  licensizer
    Pod::Licensizer comes with a command line utility, "licensizer", which
    traverses a source tree, picks files containing POD documentation, and
    refreshes their AUTHOR and LICENSE sections.

    You define a ".licensizer.yml" file at the top level of your project
    containing the desired AUTHOR and LICENSE data like

        # .licensizer.yml
        author: |
          Bodo Bravo <bodo@bravo.com>
          Zach Zulu <zach@zulu.com>

        license: |
          Copyright 2002-2011 by Bodo Bravo <bodo@bravo.com> and
          Zach Zulu <zach@zulu.com>. All rights reserved.

    and then simply run the "licensizer" script.

    This is helpful if you want to add an author to your project or change
    the year in the copyright notice. All you have to do is edit the
    ".licensizer.yml" file and run "licensizer".

    Advanced format:

        # .licensizer.yml
    
        author: 
          text: |
            Mike Schilli <cpan@perlmeister.com>
          mode: verbatim
    
        license: 
          text: |

            This program is free software, you can redistribute it and/or
            modify it under the same terms as Perl itself.

    The "verbatim" mode setting makes sure that POD doesn't reformat the
    text. This is especially useful if you use tabular data (e.g. a vertical
    column of author names).

  API
    "new"
        Constructor.

    "$licensizer->load_file( $file )"
        Load and parse a file containing POD.

    "$licensizer-">author_patch( "author text", $opts )>
        Update the POD's AUTHOR section.

    "$licensizer-">license_patch( "license text", $opts )>
        Update the POD's LICENSE section.

    "$licensizer-">write_file( $filename )>
        Write back the file. If $filename is omitted, the original file is
        overwritten.

IS LICENSIZER A WORD?
    Strictly speaking, no. But what a boring world that would be if you
    couldn't make up your own words.

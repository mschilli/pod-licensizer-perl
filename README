NAME
    Pod::Licensizer - Keep your project's AUTHOR and LICENSE sections in

SYNOPSIS
        # Command line:
        $ licensizer

        # API:
        use Pod::Licensizer;

        my $licensizer = Pod::Licensizer->new();
        $licensizer->load_file( "MyModule.pm" );

        $licensizer->write_file();

DESCRIPTION
    Pod::Licensizer helps keeping AUTHOR and LICENSE sections in sync across
    many source files in a project.

  licensizer
    Pod::Licensizer comes with a command line utility, "licensizer", which
    traverses a source tree, picks files containing POD documentation, and
    refreshes their AUTHOR and LICENSE sections.

    You define a ".licensizer.yml" file at the top level of your project
    containing the desired AUTHOR and LICENSE data like

        # .licensizer.yml
        author: |
          Bodo Bravo <bodo@bravo.com>
          Zach Zulu <zach@zulu.com>

        copyright: |
          Copyright 2002-2011 by Bodo Bravo <bodo@bravo.com> and
          Zach Zulu <zach@zulu.com>. All rights reserved.

    and then simply run the "licensizer" script.

    This is helpful if you want to add an author to your project or change
    the year in the copyright notice. All you have to do is edit the
    ".licensizer.yml" file and run "licensizer".

    Advanced format:

        # .licensizer.yml
    
        author: 
          text: |
            Mike Schilli <cpan@perlmeister.com>
